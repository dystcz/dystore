# Changelog

## 0.8.3

* Find order redundancy by @theimerj in https://github.com/dystcz/lunar-api/pull/91. Added more actions which can find order by payment intent id. This increases the success rate of identifying the order connected with the payment intent. Especially useful when data integrity is not ideal.
